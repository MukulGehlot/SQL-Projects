## Introduction
The project aims to assist the merchandising team in analyzing their sales performance and generate a basic financial report to share with the wider business. The analysis is performed at the product, sales, and transactions level and a reporting solution has been developed to automate the end entire analysis and reporting process.

## Entity Relationship Diagram
``product_details`` table includes all information about the entire range of products.

``Sales`` table contains product-level information for all the transactions made for Balanced Tree including quantity, price, percentage discount, member status, a transaction ID, and also the transaction timestamp.

## Tools
MySQL

## Methodology
### Analysis
* Performed analysis at product, transaction, and sales levels by developing SQL queries.
* For this data from ``sales`` table and ``product_details`` table were used.

### Reporting
* Created a new table ``sales_m`` to store the required monthly sales data. This has the same structure as the ``sales`` table.
* Created two procedures and combined them into one procedure to automate the entire reporting process for the required month and year.
* Created 1st procedure ``monthly_sales_4 `` with input parameters - month and year. The purpose of the procedure is to get the sales data from the ``sales`` table based on the month and year and insert it into the new table ``sales_m``. Every time this procedure is executed, the older records of the year and month are removed and new records are inserted.
* Created 2nd procedure ``auto_select`` without any input parameter. The purpose of this procedure is to run all the select queries for  product, transaction, and sales analysis on the sales data in the new table ``sales_m``.
* Created 3rd procedure ``report`` with input parameters - month and year. The purpose of the procedure is to combine the 1st and 2nd procedures. It will first
extract the data from the ``sales`` table for the required year and month and insert it into the ``sales_m`` table. And then run all the queries for reporting.
