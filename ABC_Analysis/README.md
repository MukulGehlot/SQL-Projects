## Introduction
ABC analysis is is a popular inventory management technique that categorizes inventory into three segments based on the value or importance of each stock-keeping unit (SKU). It is done to understand which segment of the inventory is most valuable or critical to the business. Through this analysis, organizations can rank their inventory and manage them efficiently.<br>
The value of each of the units or Stock keeping units (SKU) is analyzed and segmented into 3 buckets or segments — ``A``, ``B`` and ``C``.

* **A**: High-value items which represents a smaller portion of the entire inventory. This items being most valued and critical to the business, are closely tracked and managed.

* **B**: Medium-value items are not as critical as segment A items. But these are also tracked and manage.

* **C**: Low-value items which represents a large portion of the entire inventory. This items are not so closely tracked and are managed loosely.

## Tools 
* MySQL
* Microsoft Excel

## Approach
* Calculate the **revenue** of each product and sort it in the descending order.
* Calculate the **cummulative revenue**, **percentage of cummulative revenue** and **percentage of inventory** of each product.
* Based on the **percentage of cummulative revenue**, each product is given a segment - A,B,C.
* Calculate the **total inventory**, **percentage of inventory**, **total revenue**, and **percentage of revenue** of each of the segment.
* For graphical representation, plot **percentage of inventory** in **x-axis** and **percentage of cummulative revenue** in **y-axis**. 

## Entity Relationship Diagram
Two data tables are used:
```products``` and  ```order_details```

## Step by Step ABC Analysis
#  ABC Analysis Using Excel & SQL

ABC analysis is is a popular inventory management technique that categorizes inventory into three segments based on the value or importance of each stock-keeping unit (SKU). It is done to understand which segment of the inventory is most valuable or critical to the business. Through this analysis, organizations can rank their inventory and manage them efficiently.

The value of each of the units or Stock keeping units (SKU) is analyzed and segmented into 3 buckets or segments — A, B and C.

**_A:_** _High-value items which represents a smaller portion of the entire inventory. This items being most valued and critical to the business, are closely tracked and managed._

**_B:_** _Medium-value items are not as critical as segment A items. But these are also tracked and manage._

**_C:_** _Low-value items which represents a large portion of the entire inventory. This items are not so closely tracked and are managed loosely._

ABC Analysis is based on  [**Pareto Principle**](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/economics/pareto-principle/). This principle states that 80% of the outcome comes from 20% of the input.

**For example**:

-   80% of revenues come from 20% of the customers
-   80% of the crashes come from 20% of the bugs
-   80% of the result come from 20% of the workers

Similarly, 80% of the revenue or value comes from 20% of the SKUs. So, businesses try to control and manage this 20% of the inventory efficiently to optimize their inventory management, reduce inventory costs, and increase profitability.

# Advantages of ABC Analysis

ABC Analysis allows:

-   To focus on the most valuable items in their storage, management and overall utilization.
-   To make the inventory management more efficient.
-   To save money and resources through proper inventory control.
-   To avoid stock-out or overstocks of the items.

# ABC Analysis using Excel

**Step 1:**  Open the data sets in the Excel. Select the entire data and convert it into a  **Table** from  **Insert > Table**.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*HaMh15han6P1fcRTysh2Ng.png)

**Step 2:** Name the tables as  **Products** and  **Orders**. Select the table > Design > Properties > Table Name.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*Ed77tbxhphhxNfN8sUmDyw.png)

**Step 3:** Use  **VLOOKUP** to get  **UnitPrice** and  **ProductName** column in the  **Orders** table.

> **_Formulas_**:
> 
    ProductName = VLOOKUP([@ProductID],Products, 2,FALSE)
         
    UnitPrice=VLOOKUP([@ProductID],Products,6,FALSE)

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*-DDCjDi3VFNPPMC1fmAc0w.png)

**Step 4:**  Calculate  **Revenue.**

> **_Formula_**_:_

    Revenue =[@Quantity]*[@UnitPrice]

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*xdwWJLJhnzMLOE76hhWqLg.png)

Step 5: In the  **Orders** table we will have data at a order line level, but we need the  **Revenue** of each product i.e., data at product level. For that copy the  **ProductID** and  **ProductName** columns and paste it in the same sheet after a few columns. Convert it as a table, rename if you want (I have renamed it as ABC_Analysis) and use  **Remove Duplicate** option to get distinct products.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*U97I-vpys0ujm8m3i_MVUw.png)

**Step 6:**  Calculate the total revenue at product level by adding new column to the product level table we created above.

> **_Formula:_**

    Revenue = SUMIF(Orders[ProductID],[@ProductID],Orders[Revenue])

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*wL8UBJ3KCz25GAkIhsuElQ.png)

**Step 7:**  Sort the  **Revenue** in Descending order. Add a column  **Rank** and fill in starting from 1.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:534/1*vVHOw7JOGcpxtPBmbAXtgQ.png)

**Step 8:**  Calculate  **Cumulative Revenue, Total Revenue, Cumulative Percentage of Revenue**  for each product.

> **_Formulas_:**
> 

    CumRev =SUM($N$2:N2)
    
    TotalRev =SUM([Revenue])
     
    % of Cum Rev =[@CummRev]/[@TotalRev]
    
    % of Inventory =K2/COUNT($K$2:$K$78)

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*gG4Z4uYKwSffNEBWQ-Ghnw.png)

**Step 9:**  Now we will decide the segment for each product based on the cumulative revenue.

> **_Formula:_**

    ABC =IF([@[% of Cum Rev]]<40%,”A”,IF([@[% of Cum Rev]]<70%,”B”,”C”))

> Here, we are giving condition as: Segment A if the  **% of Cum Rev**  is less than 40, Segment B if  **% of Cum Rev**  is less than 70 or else Segment C.

We can use  **Conditional Formatting** to fill color to cells according to the segment.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*PODXYnxIELXzD75mdtYHtA.png)

**Step 10:** After we have segmented the products or inventory, we will conclude our observation by calculating segment level revenue percentage and the percentage of inventory.

After a few blank rows, we will create a  **summary table** where we will calculate  **Count of Inventory, Total Inventory, Total Revenue, % of Inventory** and  **% of Revenue**.

> 

**Formulas:**

    Total Inventory =COUNTIF(Table2[ABC],[@[ABC Segment]])
     
    Total Revenue =SUMIF(Table2[ABC],[@[ABC Segment]],Table2[Revenue])
    
    % of Inventory =[@[Count of Inventory]]/COUNT($K$2:$K$78)
     
    % of Revenue =[@[Total Revenue]]/SUM(Table2[Revenue])

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:699/1*XLPz6IaX5yP_4ztqSER7Pg.png)

**Step 11:**  Finally, we can create a graph. Plot  **% of Inventory in x-axis** and  **% of Cum Rev in y-axis** from product level table.

# Conclusion

Using both Excel and SQL we get similar result as the process we implemented is same.  **_We observe that around 37% of the revenue is generated from 8% of the inventory._**
